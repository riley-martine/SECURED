    h1 The Story of SECURED
    p SECURED was started by students that were personally by infectious diseases and consequently appalled at the lack of attention infectious diseases receive. Utilizing the STEM-centered environment of NCSSM, Shiv Patel and Vibhu Ambil reached out to fellow students to develop a board of directors for SECURED. Working alongside George Dimitrov, Shrey Patel, Adam Gogal, and Bhavana Ambil, they were able to found SECURED, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the fight against infectious and lesser-known diseases through awareness, fundraising, and research.
